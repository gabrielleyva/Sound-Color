# Sound-Color

##About
Sound Color is a simple elegant app that uses the particle engine from SpriteKit to create a particle that changes color based on 
the sound (chords / frquencies) it hears through the microphone. It uses the Frameworks Beethoven and Pitchy to calculate the frequency and notes as well as a simple original algorithm to change the colors of the particles.
